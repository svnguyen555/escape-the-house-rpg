# escape-the-house-rpg
A text-based C++ RPG where players explore a haunted house, battle monsters, and escape. An old project I made for a class assignment a few years ago. The goal of the assignment was to design a game that runs in a terminal environment (replit) using basic object oriented programming and simple game logic.

## Gameplay Overview

- Explore multiple interconnected rooms using directional commands (N, S, E, W).  
- Battle various monsters, each with unique stats and ASCII art.  
- Collect weapons, potions, and armor to strengthen your character.  
- Discover a secret room that holds a powerful item.  
- Beat the final boss to escape the witch’s house.

## Design Features

- Object-oriented structure for rooms, player, monsters, and inventory.  
- Turn-based combat with random damage calculations.  
- Simple ASCII-style map and battle visuals.  
- Input validation and command menus.  
- Replayable design with randomized encounters.

## Running the Game

- The game was originally designed to be ran on replit so there may be issues running certain code or displaying ASCII art when running on anything else.
- However the game should be able to run just fine on any other IDE or terminal.
